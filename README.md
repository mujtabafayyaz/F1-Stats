# F1 Stats

## What is it?
This program allows you to search for any formula 1 driver or constructor since 1950 and thus show them their standings position. The user can specify the standings of the driver/constructor to be shown after each round of a specified season or throughout the whole career. The data is presented in a line graph format. 

## Disclaimer
Currently the program does not have the functionality for "Driver Performance" or "Constructor Performance", though I am currently working on this. In addition, for the driver/constructor image to be displayed, node must be installed on the user's machine. 

## Setup
1. Node must be installed on the user's machine for image scraping functionality to work, though this is not necassary for the program to work.
2. After installing Node, open the terminal and navigate to the "server" directory inside the repository
3. Type in the following commands:
  * npm install express
  * npm install puppeteer
  * npm install body_parser
4. Before opening the HTML page, navigate back to the repository directory and type the command:
  * node server/index.js
5. Now the HTML page can be opened and interacted with
